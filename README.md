FeelGod is a wellness and creativity app that turns emotional check-ins into visual experiences. Instead of traditional mood tracking, users create “MoodBoards” that reflect how they feel using images, quotes, colors, and even sounds. The app uses an emotion to aesthetic engine to suggest content that visually represents the user’s state of mind. Over time, users build a personal archive of their emotional journey, allowing for deeper self awareness and creative reflection.

FeelGod also features an anonymized sharing space where users can post their MoodBoards to inspire others. It’s a space for visual journaling, emotional discovery, and quiet connection.
